Makes inserting shortocodes easier for users who don't want to remember any code!

== Description ==

By creating shortcodes in the settings area of the WordPress admin, this plugin 
magically creates a list of selectable easy to read and remember shortcodes 
directly in the TinyMCE editor! Whaaaat? Yes, you read that correctly, we made 
something I'm sure many of your clients have asked for. Well that is, if you have 
experienced clients like we have from time to time. But hey, who are we kidding, 
we hate remembering those shortcodes too!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `better-shortcodes` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set Options and create your first item in the `Settings/Shortcodes` Admin Menu Link
4. Place shortcodes in your post(s) or pages using the drop down list!
5. Wait for the golf tournament style clapping to start.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
